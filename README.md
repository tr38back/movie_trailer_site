# movie_trailer_site
This is a movie trailer website that I built as a part of my Udacity Full Stack Web Developer projects.

The object is to create a dynamic website from a Python script.
In order to run, Python must be installed. Once installed, open entertainment_center.py in the interface and run the script.

It will generate a movie trailer website with several movies, their production information, a drop-down storyline, and a responsive modal popup movie trailer.
